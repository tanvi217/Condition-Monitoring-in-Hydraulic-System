# Condition-Monitoring-in-Hydraulic-System
Given sensor readings of 17 sensors used by the hydraulic test rig that quantify the machineâ€™s health, the objective is to present classification-based methods for inferring condition variables such as cooler condition, internal pump leakage and hydraulic accumulator from the sensor data streams.
